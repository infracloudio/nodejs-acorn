======

Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Here we have a Battelship game using [this repo](https://github.com/kubowania/battleships). There are two options available you can play it as a single player or multiplayer. If you are playing it as multiplayer select multiplayer and then open the link in the second browser which will act as second player.
